# Homework - Currency Converter

## Learning Objectives

- Practice setting up a Vue application
- Read data from an API
- Handle user interaction and practice business logic
- Practice implementing computed properties

### Brief

You have been asked to build a currency exchange calculator.

Use the data from [this url](https://api.exchangeratesapi.io/latest) to allow the user to convert from Euro to any of the listed currencies.

### MVP

The app should load the exchange rates when the page loads.

```
  mounted(){
    // ...
  }
```

The user should be able to enter an amount which they can then:
 - convert from Euros into a selected currency
 - convert from a selected currency into Euros

Make sure you appropriately format any currencies displayed to the user (_i.e._ to two decimal places).

### Extensions

- Allow cross-currency conversions - from non-base to non-base currencies. (e.g. from GBP to USD)
- Research how Vue's [filters](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/filters.html) allow for formatting of output and implement them where appropriate.
